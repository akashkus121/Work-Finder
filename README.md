<h5  align ="center"> 
Work Finder is a full-stack job portal web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The platform allows users to register, search for jobs, and apply directly. The system also supports two separate login portals: one for recruiters to post job opportunities and manage listings, and another for students to search for jobs and manage applications. </h5>

## Configuration and Setup

In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine.

- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the Frontend on one terminal and the Backend on the other terminal)

In the first terminal

```
$ cd Frontend
$ npm install (to install frontend-side dependencies)
$ npm run  start (to start the frontend)
```

In the second terminal

- cd Backend and Set environment variables in config.env under ./config
- Create your mongoDB connection url, which you'll use as your MONGO_URI
- Supply the following credentials

```
#  ---  Config.env  ---

NODE_ENV = development
PORT =5000
URI =http://localhost:3000
MONGO_URI =
JWT_SECRET_KEY =
CLOUD_NAME=dlbtwfubs
API_KEY=
API_SECRET=
``
# --- Terminal ---

$ npm install (to install backend-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the backend)
```
